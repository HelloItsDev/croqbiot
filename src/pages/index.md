story:
  story1: 'A proper Pão de Queijo is a two-bite business: crunchy on the outside and
                fluffy on the inside. Made with cassava flour and fresh cheese, it’s a
                farmer’s take on traditional European bread - without the wheat. Pão de
                Queijo is a staple snack at most cafes, restaurants and dinner parties
                across Brazil. It’s cheesily addictive and naturally gluten free.'
  story2: 'Try pairing it with a short black coffee São Paulo style, or spread thickly
                with guava<sup className="-yellow">&#9679;</sup> jam for a sweet contrast.'

  footnote: 'Guava jam is made with guava, a tropical fruit that’s sweet and aromatic.
                It’s the most popular dip for Pão de Queijo. You can use your favourite
                english jam as a substitute.'
