story1: 'A proper Pão de Queijo is a two-bite business: crunchy on the outside and
							fluffy on the inside. Made with cassava flour and fresh cheese, it’s a
							farmer’s take on traditional European bread - without the wheat. Pão de
							Queijo is a staple snack at most cafes, restaurants and dinner parties
              across Brazil. It’s cheesily addictive and naturally gluten free.'
story2: 'Try pairing it with a short black coffee São Paulo style, or spread thickly
              with guava<sup className="-yellow">&#9679;</sup> jam for a sweet contrast.'
footnote: 'Guava jam is made with guava, a tropical fruit that’s sweet and aromatic.
							It’s the most popular dip for Pão de Queijo. You can use your favourite
							english jam as a substitute.'

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
