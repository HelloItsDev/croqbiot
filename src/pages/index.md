    Guava jam is made with guava, a tropical fruit that’s sweet and aromatic.
    It’s the most popular dip for Pão de Queijo. You can use your favourite
    english jam as a substitute.

    A proper Pão de Queijo is a two-bite business: crunchy on the outside and
    fluffy on the inside. Made with cassava flour and fresh cheese, it’s a
    farmer’s take on traditional European bread - without the wheat. Pão de
    Queijo is a staple snack at most cafes, restaurants and dinner parties
    across Brazil. It’s cheesily addictive and naturally gluten free.
  story2: >-
    Try pairing it with a short black coffee São Paulo style, or spread thickly
    with guava<sup className="-yellow">&#9679;</sup> jam for a sweet contrast.
